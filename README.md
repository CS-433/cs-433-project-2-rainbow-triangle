## Introduction

## Data

Label -1 - negative  
Lab1l 1 - positive  

## Dependencies
To properly run our code you will have to install some dependencies. Our suggestion is to use a Python environment (we used Anaconda). GRU and Bert are built on TensorFlow, with Keras as a wrapper, while the baseline has been done in scikit-learn.

- tensorflow 2.3.1 `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`
- scikit-learn 0.23.2 `pip install -U scikit-learn`
- transformers 3.4.0  `pip install transformers`
