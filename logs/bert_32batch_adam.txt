Some layers from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing TFBertForSequenceClassification: ['nsp___cls', 'mlm___cls']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some layers of TFBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['dropout_37', 'classifier']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
